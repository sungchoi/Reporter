Crowd reporting app.

To get started, you need to create a username and password in the web UI.

You can get a token by POSTing to:

/api/v1/tokens.json

with params username: <username>
            password: <password>

Then you can authenticate with the token. For example, you can POST JSON
to /reports and create a report.
